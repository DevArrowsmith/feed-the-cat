#Feed the Cat

This repo is a short exercise in the creation of a controller for a cat feeding database.

The application will use Express and Sequelize to update a database of cats and their last feedings.

The guide is [here](https://hackmd.io/k9O1pQE0TuOVN4lcgpAlYQ?view).

NB: The password for the local database is currently saves within this repo, in index.js, for convenience. In a real app **this should not be done**. Passwords should be stored securely. One option is to store secure details in a .env file added to .gitignore.
